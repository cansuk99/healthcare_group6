üè• Predicting Hospital Readmissions for Diabetic Patients

This project investigates whether early hospital readmissions (within 30 days) for diabetic patients can be predicted based on clinical and demographic information collected from 130 US hospitals between 1999 and 2008.

The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, includes over 100,000 encounters with details about patient demographics, diagnoses, lab results, and medications.
The goal is to determine whether these features contain enough information to build a reliable predictive model.
